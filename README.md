# üï∞Ô∏è Luxurious Watches Website

A sleek, responsive landing page showcasing an exquisite selection of luxury watches. The website dynamically updates product details and styling based on the watch selected in the carousel, providing users with an engaging experience that highlights elegance and precision craftsmanship.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Update**: As users switch between watches in the carousel, the product details (description, price, and headings) are dynamically updated.
- **Background Color Change**: The background color of the webpage changes based on the selected watch, ensuring a cohesive aesthetic that matches the product.
- **Automatic Text Color Adjustment**: To maintain readability, the text color adapts to the brightness of the background color, switching between black and white when necessary.
- **Sign-up CTA (Call-to-Action)**: A prominent "Sign up" button encourages user interaction. (Note: Placeholder functionality included).
- **Watch Carousel**: An interactive carousel that lets users explore various watch models.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the webpage, including background gradients and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For dynamically updating content and handling user interactions.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons representing social media and other UI elements.

## How It Works

- **Watch Data**: Each watch in the carousel has its own details, including a description, price, and a unique background color, which are stored in a JavaScript array.
- **Carousel Functionality**: As users click the next/previous buttons, the webpage updates to show the selected watch, along with changing the background color and adjusting the text color to ensure readability.
- **Brightness Detection**: A function calculates the brightness of the background color to determine if the text should be black or white for optimal visibility.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
